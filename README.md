#### Data

ratioDistrict.csv contains some data about disparities in punishments for various groups and school districts, to be imported into the Leaflet school district map. The column names that we were planning to map are in this format:

    ratio (ECO. DISADV.|SPEC. ED.|BLACK OR AFRICAN AMERICAN|HISPANIC/LATINO|WHITE|AMERICAN INDIAN OR ALASKA NAT|ASIAN|NATIVE HAWAIIAN/OTHER PACIFIC|TWO OR MORE RACES) (EXPULSION ACTIONS|IN SCHOOL SUSPENSIONS|OUT OF SCHOOL SUSPENSIONS|DAEP PLACEMENTS) vs average

That means the map will need 36 buttons (9 groups times 4 punishments) to show all the data we want to display.
